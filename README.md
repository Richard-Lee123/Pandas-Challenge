Welcome to the world of the Heroes of Pymoli!

In this challenge I have been given the opportunity to work with the data involving users and their in game purchases for the game "Heroes of Pymoli." Here we will break down the user demographics and find purchase trends for this game.

### Data

I started by searching for the total numbers of individual players that purchased something in the game, the total came out to be 576 individuals.
|Total Individuals|
|---|
|576|

Next I analyzed the data, what I found is listed below in this table.

|Numbers of Unique Items| Average Price| Numbers of Player Purchases| Total Revenue|
|---|---|---|---|
|179| $3.05| 708| $2379.77|

I then broke down the players demographics based on gender, and did an anylysis on that to find the spending for each gender group.

|Gender| Total Count| Percentage of Players|
|---|---|---|
|Male|484|84.03%|
|Female|81|14.06%|
|Other/Non-Disclosed|11|1.91%|


|Gender|Purchase Count|	Average Purchase Price|	Total Purchase Value|	Avg Total Purchase per Person|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Male|	652|	$3.02|	$1967.64|	$4.07|
