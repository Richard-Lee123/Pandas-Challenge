Welcome to the world of the Heroes of Pymoli!

In this challenge I have been given the opportunity to work with the data involving users and their in game purchases for the game "Heroes of Pymoli." Here we will break down the user demographics and find purchase trends for this game.

### Tools
The file of data we looked was located in our Resources folder, labeled as purchase_data.csv. the tools we used to process this data frame was "Jupyter Notebook," and "Pandas."

### Data

I started by searching for the total numbers of individual players that purchased something in the game, the total came out to be 576 individuals.
|Total Individuals|
|---|
|576|

Next I analyzed the data, what I found is listed below in this table.

|Numbers of Unique Items| Average Price| Numbers of Player Purchases| Total Revenue|
|---|---|---|---|
|179| $3.05| 708| $2379.77|

I then broke down the players demographics based on gender, and did an anylysis on that to find the spending for each gender group.

#### Demographics
|Gender| Total Count| Percentage of Players|
|---|---|---|
|Male|484|84.03%|
|Female|81|14.06%|
|Other/Non-Disclosed|11|1.91%|

#### Statistic
|Gender|Purchase Count|	Average Purchase Price|	Total Purchase Value|	Avg Total Purchase per Person|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Male|	652|	$3.02|	$1967.64|	$4.07|
|Female|	113|	$3.20|	$361.94|	$4.47|
|Other / Non-Disclosed|	15|	$3.35|	$50.19|	$4.56|

After looking at Gender I took a look at the Age Demographics, which can be seen below.

### Findings

After analyzing all of this data I can come to three conclusions just by observing these tables.
Firstly I can conclude that majority of the playerbase is Male, and that is where majority of the purchases are coming from. With almost 85% of players being male and almost $2,000.00 coming from this gender group.
Secondly I would say that if we graphed the age demographics we would be able to see a bell curve, where majority of the player base are teenagers to 30 year old players. Any further than that on either sides of the age range and we will see a more dramatic decline in players base.
